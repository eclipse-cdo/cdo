 Before diving into CDO programming, it is essential to understand some key concepts that form the foundation of CDO.
 They are explained in the following sections:

<h2><a name="ConceptModels"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Models</h2>
<p>
 CDO is designed to work with EMF models. An EMF model is a structured representation of data that conforms to a specific
 metamodel. A model consists of a graph of interconnected model objects (see below). Models can be large and complex.
 CDO allows you to store and manage these models in a distributed environment.

<h2><a name="ConceptMetaModels"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Meta Models</h2>
<p>
 A metamodel defines the structure and constraints of a model. In EMF, metamodels are typically defined using Ecore, which is a
 modeling language for defining models. CDO works with any EMF metamodel, allowing you to store and manage models based on different metamodels.
 In an Ecore metamodel, you define EPackages, EClasses, EAttributes, and EReferences to represent the concepts and relationships in your domain.

<h2><a name="ConceptModelObjects"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Model Objects</h2>
<p>
 In EMF, model objects are instances of EObject, which is the base class for all EMF model elements. Each EObject
 corresponds to an instance of an EClass defined in the metamodel and, hence, has a set of
 structural features (attributes and references) that define its properties and relationships with other model objects.
 In CDO, model objects are instances of CDOObject, which extends EObject and adds additional functionality for working in a distributed environment,
 most notably a technical unique identifier, the CDOID.

<h2><a name="ConceptResources"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources</h2>
<p>
 In EMF, a resource is a container for model objects. It provides a way to group related model objects together and manage their
 persistence. Resources are typically stored in files, such as XMI or XML files.
 <p>
 CDO extends the concept of resources by providing CDOResource,
 which is a specialized resource that is designed to work with CDO's distributed shared model framework. CDOResources are stored in a CDO repository
 and can be accessed and manipulated by multiple clients concurrently. CDOResources can be organized in a hierarchical structure using CDOResourceFolder.
 This allows you to create a tree-like structure of resources, similar to a file system.
 <p>
 CDOResourceFolders can also contain CDOBinaryResources
 and CDOTextResources to store binary large objects (LOBs) and text files, respectively.
 <p>
 All these resource types are subtypes of CDOResourceNode.
 CDOResourceNodes are regular CDOObjects and are, therefore, part of the versioned and shared model themselves.

<h2><a name="ConceptBranches"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Branches</h2>
<p>
 CDO supports branching, which allows you to create multiple versions of a model. Each branch represents a separate line of development,
 allowing you to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the mainline version of the model.

<h2><a name="ConceptBranchPoints"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;Branch Points</h2>
<p>
 A branch point is a specific point in time on a branch. It represents a snapshot of the model at that point in time.
 Branch points are used to manage versions of the model and to perform operations such as merging and comparing different versions.
 In each branch there are two special branch points: <i>BASE</i> and <i>HEAD</i>. BASE represents the fixed point where the branch was created,
 HEAD represents the latest point in time on the branch, a floating point that moves forward on the branch as time progresses.

<h2><a name="ConceptCommits"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;Commits</h2>
<p>
 A commit represents a set of changes made to a model. Each commit occurs at a specific time and
 is associated with a specific branch. A commit is a branch point, but not every branch point is a commit.
 Although CDO processes commits in parallel, it ensures that each commit is associated with a unique timestamp.
 This timestamp is the Commit ID.

<h2><a name="ConceptRevisions"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;Revisions</h2>
<p>
 A revision represents a specific version of a specific model object. Each time a model object is modified and committed,
 a new revision is created. Revisions are identified by a combination of the object's CDOID, the branch, and the version number. The version number
 of a revision is specific to and unique within the revision's branch. In addition, each revision has a creation time, which is the
 timestamp of the commit that created it. Unless the revision is the latest one of the object on the branch, it also has a revised time,
 which is the creation time (minus one millisecond) of the next revision of the same object on the same branch. Revisions are immutable,
 except for when they represent the dirty state of an object within a client transaction. Revisions are the data transfer objects that CDO uses
 to send model object data between clients and the server.

<h2><a name="ConceptRevisionDeltas"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;Revision Deltas</h2>
<p>
 A revision delta represents a set of changes made to a specific revision of a model object.
 It is used to efficiently transmit only the changes made to a model object, rather than the entire object. It consists of the CDOID of the object,
 the version number of the revision being modified, and a set of changes to the object's attributes and references, the so-called feature deltas.

<h2><a name="ConceptRepositories"></a>10&nbsp;&nbsp;Repositories</h2>
<p>
 A CDO repository is a central storage location for EMF models and metamodels. It provides a way to store, version,
 retrieve, and manage models in a distributed environment. A repository can contain multiple models and metamodels. The models
 are stored in the form of revisions, which are created each time a model object is modified and committed. Whether historical revisions
 are retained or not depends on the repository's configuration. Also, whether branching is supported or not depends on the repository's configuration.
 Although metamodels are models themselves, they can not be versioned or branched. Instead, they are managed separately from regular models.
 A repository is hosted by a CDO server and accessed by CDO clients.

<h2><a name="ConceptSessions"></a>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Sessions</h2>
<p>
 A CDO session represents a connection to a CDO repository. It is used to perform basic operations on the
 repository, such as loading metamodels, branches, and revisions. A session can be associated with a specific user,
 allowing for authentication and authorization. It is the main entry point for interacting with a CDO repository.
 It does not provide access to model objects. For that, you need to open a view or transaction (see below).

<h2><a name="ConceptViews"></a>12&nbsp;&nbsp;Views</h2>
<p>
 A CDO view provides read-only access to a consistent graph of model objects in a repository.
 It represents the model state at a specific branch point in the repository, allowing you to navigate and query the model objects
 without modifying them. Views are opened from a session and are associated with an EMF ResourceSet, which is used to manage the
 loaded model objects. Multiple views can be opened from a single session, each, for example, representing a different branch point.
 It is an important aspect of CDO that views, together with model versions they provide, are thread-safe. This means that multiple threads can
 use the same view concurrently without causing data corruption or inconsistencies.

<h2><a name="ConceptTransactions"></a>13&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions</h2>
<p>
 A CDO transaction is a special type of view that provides read-write access to a consistent graph of model objects in a repository.
 It allows you to modify model objects and commit the changes back to the repository. Like views, transactions are opened from a session
 and are associated with an EMF ResourceSet. A transaction is always associated with the HEAD of a specific branch in the repository.

<h2><a name="ConceptChangeNotifications"></a>14&nbsp;&nbsp;Change Notifications</h2>
<p>
 All views that target the HEAD of a branch (which includes, by definition, all transactions) receive change notifications
 about changes that other clients commit to the same branch. These notifications are used to keep the model objects in the view up to date
 and to notify listeners (and EMF Adapters) about changes.
