# Contributing to CDO

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The Eclipse CDO (Connected Data Objects) Model Repository is a distributed
shared model framework for EMF models and meta models. CDO is also a model
runtime environment with a focus on orthogonal aspects like model scalability,
transactionality, persistence, distribution, queries and more. CDO has a 3-tier
architecture supporting EMF-based client applications, featuring a central model
repository server and leveraging different types of pluggable data storage
back-ends like relational databases, object databases and file systems. The
default client/server communication protocol is implemented with the Net4j
Signalling Platform.
