/**
 * Introduction to CDO Client Programming
 * <p>
 * This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts and architecture of CDO client programming. It provides an overview
 * of how CDO integrates with EMF, the essential terminology, and the building blocks required to develop robust CDO
 * client applications.
 * <p>
 * CDO (Connected Data Objects) is a model repository for EMF models, enabling distributed, scalable, and versioned
 * model management. Understanding the architecture and key concepts is crucial for leveraging CDO's capabilities in
 * your application.

  /**
   * Overview of CDO Architecture
   * <p>
   * The CDO architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate with the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), providing
   * transparent persistence, branching, and versioning for EMF models. CDO clients connect to repositories using Net4j
   * connectors, enabling efficient communication and data transfer. The architecture supports multiple sessions, views,
   * and transactions, allowing concurrent access and modification of model data.
   * <p>
   * Key architectural components include:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>CDO Sessions: Manage connections to repositories and provide access to views and transactions.</li>
   *   <li>CDO Views: Offer read-only access to model data.</li>
   *   <li>CDO Transactions: Enable modifications and commit changes to the repository.</li>
   *   <li>Net4j Connectors: Handle transport and communication between client and server.</li>
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * The architecture is extensible, supporting custom protocols, authentication mechanisms, and integration with other
   * frameworks.

  /**
   * Key Concepts and Terminology
   * <p>
   * CDO introduces several important concepts that are essential for effective client programming:
   * <ul>
   *   <li><b>Session:</b> Represents a connection to a CDO repository.</li>
   *   <li><b>View:</b> Provides a snapshot of the repository's data, typically read-only.</li>
   *   <li><b>Transaction:</b> Allows changes to be made and committed to the repository.</li>
   *   <li><b>Branch:</b> Supports parallel development and versioning of models.</li>
   *   <li><b>Revision:</b> Tracks changes to model objects over time.</li>
   *   <li><b>Resource:</b> Stores EMF model data in the repository.</li>
   *   <li><b>Commit:</b> Persists changes to the repository, creating a new revision.</li>
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * Familiarity with these terms and their roles in the CDO ecosystem is vital for building scalable and maintainable
   * client applications.
