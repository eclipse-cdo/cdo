  /**
   * Using the CDO Model Importer
   * <p>
   * The easiest way to create a CDO enabled GenModel is to use the CDO Migrator utility that is shipped with the CDO SDK.
   * It includes a special Ecore Model Importer that adjusts all the GenModel properties needed to generated CDO native models.
   * Right-click the Ecore model file and select New and Other... and choose the EMF Generator Model New Wizard:
   * <p align="center">{@image Migrator0.png}
   * <p align="center">{@image Migrator1.png}
   * <p>
   * On the next page, the Select a Model Importer page, select the Ecore model (CDO native) importer:
   * <p align="center">{@image Migrator2.png}
   * <p>
   * On the next page, the Ecore Import page, click the Load button:
   * <p align="center">{@image Migrator3.png}
   * <p>
   * On the next page, the Package Selection page, adjust the settings depending on your model and its referenced models:
   * <p align="center">{@image Migrator4.png}
   * <p>
   * After clicking the Finish button your model project should look similar to this (please note that the CDO marker
   * file META-INF/CDO.MF has also been created by the importer):
   * <p align="center">{@image Migrator5.png}

   * If you don't want to use the CDO Model Importer to automatically let a proper GenModel be created for you
   * it is still rather easy to migrate an existing GenModel by hand.
   * <p>
   * The EMF generator model for your Ecore model is much like a usual GenModel except for the following four differences:
   * <ul>
   * <li> The <i>Feature Delegation</i> property <b>must be</b> set to <code>Reflective</code>
   * <li> The <i>Model Plug-in Variables</i> property <b>should be</b> set to <code>CDO=org.eclipse.emf.cdo</code>
   * <li> The <i>Root Extends Class</i> property <b>must be</b> set to {@link CDOObjectImpl org.eclipse.emf.internal.cdo.CDOObjectImpl}
   * <li> The <i>Root Extends Interface</i> property <b>can be</b> set to {@link CDOObject org.eclipse.emf.cdo.CDOObject}
   * </ul>
   * <p align="center">{@image GenModel.png}
   * <p>
   * Note that you do not need to generate an editor if you want to use your model with the {@link Doc01_UserInterface CDO User Interface}
   * A dedicated {@link Doc_EditingModelElementsEditor model editor} is only needed if you plan to use your model with normal XML based files as well.
   * Even in this scenario it could be simpler to use the EMF Reflective Model Editor though.
   * <p>
   * The XML representation of this GenModel is:

   * call your generated method like getX() and then that calls the dynamic reflective method like eDynamicGet. It effectively produces

   * those as you could when you used "None"...
