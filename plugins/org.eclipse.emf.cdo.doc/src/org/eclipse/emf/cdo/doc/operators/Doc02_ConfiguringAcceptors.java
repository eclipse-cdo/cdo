   * The following values are possible with the shipped distribution (subject to user-supplied extension):
   * <ul>
   * <li> <b>tcp</b>: {@link ITCPAcceptor} for fast, new I/O based socket connections. The following additional attributes are recognized:
   *      <ul>
   *      <li> <b>listenAddr</b>: The network address the server socket shall be bound to.
   *           A value of <code>"0.0.0.0"</code> is the default (whole attribute can be omitted) and
   *           tells the socket to listen on <b>all</b> available addresses.
   *      <li> <b>port</b>: The network port the server socket shall be bound to.
   *           A value of <code>2036</code> is the default (whole attribute can be omitted).

   * <li> <b>ssl</b>: Similar to tcp but with transport-level security (TLS).
   * <li> <b>ws</b>: {@link IWSAcceptor} for WebSocket-based connections over HTTP.
   * <li> <b>jvm</b>: {@link IJVMAcceptor} for JVM internal (non-socket based ) connections.
