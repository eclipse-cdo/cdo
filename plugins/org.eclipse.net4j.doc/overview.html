The Net4j Signaling Platform is an extensible client/server communications framework.
</p>
	
<img src="resources/Net4j-Multiplexing.png"/>
	
<p>
Net4j eases the development of fast and maintainable application protocols that are independent
of the physical transport medium. Transport protocols are pluggable and Net4j ships with support
for TCP, HTTP and in-memory transport. The core of Net4j is a fast, asynchronous and non-blocking
buffer multiplexing kernel, based on OSGi but also executable stand-alone.
