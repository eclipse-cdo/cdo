   * Prerequisites and Dependencies
   * <p>
   * Before developing a CDO client application, ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are available. This
   * includes the CDO client libraries, EMF runtime, Net4j transport, and any additional plugins for authentication or
   * custom protocols. Review the compatibility matrix and version requirements to avoid integration issues.
   * <p>
   * Typical prerequisites:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)</li>
   *   <li>CDO Client Libraries</li>
   *   <li>Net4j Transport Libraries</li>
   *   <li>Any custom or third-party plugins</li>
