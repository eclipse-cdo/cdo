<p>
CDO is both a development-time model repository and a run-time persistence framework; being highly optimized it supports object graphs of arbitrary size.
</p>

<p>
CDO offers transactions with save points, explicit locking, change notification, remote queries, temporality, branching, merging, offline and fail-over modes.
The storage back-end is pluggable and migrations between direct JDBC, Hibernate, Objectivity/DB, MongoDB or DB4O are seamless for CDO applications.
