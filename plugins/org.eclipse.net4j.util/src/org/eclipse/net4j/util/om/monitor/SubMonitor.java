/**
 * A {@link IProgressMonitorWithBlocking progress monitor} that uses a given amount of work ticks from a parent monitor.
 * This is intended as a safer, easier-to-use alternative to {@link SubProgressMonitor}.
 * <p>
 * Progress monitoring is generally quite invasive to the code that is monitored.
 * At the same time progress monitoring itself is typically very hard to implement correctly.
 * This class aims at reducing the invasiveness as much as possible while offering all the functionality needed
 * to do the job right.
 * <p>
 * The following aspects of this class help to keep the progress monitoring code short and nice and to avoid common monitoring mistakes:
 * <ul>
 * <li> It offers the full functionality of {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.SubMonitor}, which already makes progress monitoring a lot easier.
 *      Refer to the {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.SubMonitor} documentation or to this <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Progress_Reporting">article</a> for details and examples.
 *
 * <li> In addition to the {@link SubMonitor#setWorkRemaining(int)} method it offers a {@link #skipped(int)} method, which redistributes the remaining work
 *      according to the last skipped {@link #worked(int)} or {@link #newChild(int)} call rather than on the sum of all subsequent calls.
 *
 * <li> It reduces the need to specify <code>work</code> arguments by using the default value {@link #DEFAULT_WORK 1} with the overloaded
 *      {@link #worked()}, {@link #skipped()} and {@link #newChild()} calls.
 *
 * <li> Basically all methods of this class can implicitly check for cancelation, thereby ensuring that the monitored code is always cancelable by the user
 *      without cluttering the code with repetitions of the following idiom:
 *      <pre>
if (monitor.isCanceled())
{
  throw new OperationCanceledException();
}
 *      </pre>
 *      For details about automatic cancelation detection refer to {@link #detectCancelation()}.
 *
 * <li> It is normally very challenging to find out how much time a program really spends in the different parts of the monitored methods or how often these
 *      parts get executed. Stepping through the program with a debugger obviously leads to distortion that renders the observations meaningless and adding
 *      extra code to measure a runtime scenario realistically is not nice from a maintenance point of view.
 *      <p>
 *      As a solution to this problem this class offers the possibility to transparently instrument {@link SubMonitor} instances such that they automatically
 *      collect and report all kinds of statistics that may help to enhance the user experience. Sometimes it would even indicate to remove some progress monitoring
 *      because it turns out that almost no time is being spent in a particular part of the program. Another typical result from the analysis is the understanding of
 *      <i>one time effects</i> that might need special consideration.
 *      <p>
 *      For details about this <i>probing</i> mode refer to {@link ProbingSubMonitor}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The following example shows how to monitor progress while recursing through a tree of folders:
 * <pre>
public void recurse(IContainer container, IProgressMonitor monitor) throws Exception
{
  IResource[] members = container.members();

  SubMonitor progress = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, members.length).detectCancelation();
  progress.subTask(container.getFullPath().toString());

  for (IResource member : members)
  {
    if (member instanceof IContainer)
    {
      Thread.sleep(5);
      recurse((IContainer)member, progress.newChild());
    }
    else
    {
      progress.skipped();
    }
  }
}
 * </pre>
