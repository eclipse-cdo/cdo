 This chapter describes the locking mechanisms available in CDO client applications, including lock types and
 strategies for managing concurrent access to model data. Locking is essential for ensuring data integrity and
 consistency in collaborative environments.

<h2><a name="LockTypes"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock Types</h2>
<p>
 CDO supports several types of locks to control access to model objects. This section explains the differences
 between read locks, write locks, and write option locks, and how to use them to prevent conflicts and ensure safe
 modifications.

<h3><a name="ReadLocks"></a>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Read Locks</h3>
<p>
 Read locks allow multiple clients to access model objects concurrently for reading, while preventing
 modifications. Learn how to acquire and release read locks to enable safe, concurrent navigation of repository
 data.

<h3><a name="WriteLocks"></a>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Write Locks</h3>
<p>
 Write locks provide exclusive access to model objects for modification. This section covers how to obtain write
 locks, handle lock contention, and release locks after changes are committed.

<h3><a name="WriteOptionLocks"></a>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Write Option Locks</h3>
<p>
 Write option locks are a specialized form of locking that allow clients to prepare for future write operations.
 Learn how to use write option locks to optimize transaction workflows and reduce lock contention.

<h2><a name="OptimisticLocking"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimistic Locking</h2>
<p>
 Optimistic locking assumes that conflicts are rare and allows clients to proceed with changes without acquiring
 locks up front. This section explains how optimistic locking works in CDO, how to detect and resolve conflicts at
 commit time, and best practices for using optimistic strategies.

<h2><a name="PessimisticLocking"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Pessimistic Locking</h2>
<p>
 Pessimistic locking requires clients to acquire locks before making changes, preventing other clients from
 modifying the same objects concurrently. Learn how to implement pessimistic locking in CDO, manage lock lifecycles,
 and avoid deadlocks.

<h2><a name="DurableLocking"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Durable Locking</h2>
<p>
 Durable locks persist across client disconnects and server restarts, ensuring long-term protection of model
 objects. This section covers how to create, manage, and release durable locks, and when to use them in your
 application.
