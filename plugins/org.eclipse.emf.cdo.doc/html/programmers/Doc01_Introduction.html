 CDO is a model repository and distributed shared model framework for EMF models. It enables
 collaborative editing of EMF models in a distributed environment, providing features such as
 transactions, versioning, and branching.
 <p>
 This documentation is intended for developers who want to use CDO in their applications.
 It assumes that you have a basic understanding of EMF, Net4j and Java development with Eclipse.
 Here are some pointers to other documentation that may be helpful:
 <ul>
 <li>The <a href="https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/guide/intro/pde_overview.htm">Plug-in Development Environment Guide</a> provides information about developing Eclipse plug-ins.
 <li>The <a href="https://eclipse.dev/emf/docs.html">EMF Documentation</a> provides comprehensive information about EMF concepts and APIs.
 <li>The <a href="../../../org.eclipse.net4j.doc/html/Overview.html" title="Article in Net4j Signalling Platform Documentation">Net4j Signalling Platform Documentation</a> explains the underlying communication framework used by CDO.
 <li>The <a href="../../../org.eclipse.net4j.db.doc/html/Overview.html" title="Article in Net4j DB Framework Documentation">Net4j DB Framework Documentation</a> explains the database access framework used by CDO.
 <li>The <a href="../../../org.eclipse.net4j.util.doc/html/Overview.html" title="Article in Net4j Utilities Documentation">Net4j Utilities Documentation</a> explains various utility classes used by CDO.
 </ul>
 <p>
 This documentation about CDO programming is split into two main parts:
 <ul>
 <li><a href="client/index.html" title="Category in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Developing Client Applications</a>: A guide for developing client applications that use CDO to store and manage EMF models in a distributed environment.
 <li><a href="server/index.html" title="Category in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Developing Server Applications</a>: A guide for developing server applications that provide CDO repositories for client applications.
 </ul>
 <p>
 Before diving into CDO programming, it is essential to understand some key concepts that form the foundation of CDO.
 They are explained in <a href="Doc02_KeyConcepts.html" title="Article in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Key Concepts of CDO</a>.
 <p>
 Instructions for preparing your development environment are provided in <a href="Doc03_PreparingWorkspace.html" title="Article in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Preparing the Workspace</a>.
 This includes setting up your Eclipse workspace with the necessary dependencies.
 <p>
 Instructions for preparing your EMF models for use with CDO are provided in <a href="Doc04_PreparingModels.html" title="Article in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Preparing EMF Models</a>.
 This includes creating Ecore models and generating CDO-enabled code.
 <p>
 At the end of this Programmer's Guide, you find the chapter <a href="DocXX_InstallingSources.html" title="Article in CDO Model Repository Documentation">Installing the Sources</a> with
 instructions for installing the CDO sources into your workspace. This is only necessary if you want to
 work on CDO itself or want to analyze the commit history of CDO.
