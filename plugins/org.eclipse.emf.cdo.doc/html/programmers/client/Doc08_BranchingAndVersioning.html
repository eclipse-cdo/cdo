 This chapter describes how to work with branches and versions in CDO client applications. Branching and versioning
 are essential for supporting parallel development, tracking changes, and maintaining historical data in model
 repositories.
 <p>
 CDO provides powerful APIs for creating, navigating, and merging branches, as well as accessing and comparing
 historical versions of model objects. Understanding these features enables advanced collaboration and data management
 scenarios.

<h2><a name="WorkingWithBranches"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with Branches</h2>
<p>
 Branches allow multiple lines of development within a CDO repository. This section explains how to create new
 branches, switch between branches, and manage branch hierarchies. Learn best practices for using branches to
 support feature development, bug fixes, and release management.

<h2><a name="AccessingHistoricalVersions"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessing Historical Versions</h2>
<p>
 CDO tracks all changes to model objects, enabling access to historical versions. This section covers how to query
 and retrieve previous states of objects, analyze change history, and restore data from earlier revisions.

<h2><a name="ComparingVersions"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing Versions</h2>
<p>
 Comparing versions is crucial for understanding changes, resolving conflicts, and merging branches. Learn how to
 use CDO's APIs to compare object states across branches and revisions, and visualize differences in model data.

<h2><a name="MergingChanges"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Merging Changes</h2>
<p>
 Merging changes from different branches or versions is a common task in collaborative development. This section
 explains how to merge model data, resolve conflicts, and ensure data integrity during merges.
