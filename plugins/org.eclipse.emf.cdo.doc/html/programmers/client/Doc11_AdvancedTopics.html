 This chapter covers advanced topics for CDO client application programmers. Explore advanced customization,
 performance tuning, efficient handling of large models, and troubleshooting techniques to build robust and scalable
 CDO applications.
 <p>
 These topics are essential for developers who need to extend CDO, optimize resource usage, and resolve complex
 issues in production environments.

<h2><a name="CustomViewProviders"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Custom View Providers</h2>
<p>
 Extend CDO by implementing custom view providers to support specialized access patterns, security requirements, or
 integration scenarios. Learn how to register and use custom view providers to tailor repository access to your
 application's needs.

<h2><a name="OptimizingPerformance"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimizing Performance</h2>
<p>
 Performance optimization is critical for large-scale and high-traffic CDO applications. This section covers
 strategies for reducing memory usage, minimizing network overhead, tuning fetch rules, and leveraging caching
 mechanisms to achieve optimal performance.

<h2><a name="HandlingLargeModelsEfficiently"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling Large Models Efficiently</h2>
<p>
 Large models present unique challenges in terms of memory management, data loading, and responsiveness. Learn best
 practices for partitioning models, using lazy loading, and managing resource sets to handle large models
 efficiently in CDO.

<h2><a name="TroubleshootingAndDebugging"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubleshooting and Debugging</h2>
<p>
 Effective troubleshooting and debugging are essential for maintaining application stability. This section provides
 guidance on diagnosing common issues, using CDO and Net4j logging, analyzing stack traces, and employing debugging
 tools to resolve problems quickly.
