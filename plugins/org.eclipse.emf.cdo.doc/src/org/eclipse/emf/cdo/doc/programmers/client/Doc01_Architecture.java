/**
 * Architecture of a Client Application
 * <p>
 * The architecture of a CDO application is characterized by its mandatory dependency on EMF, the Eclipse Modeling
 * Framework. Most of the time an application interacts with the object graph of the model through standard EMF APIs
 * because CDO model graph objects are {@link EObject EObjects}. While CDO's basic functionality integrates nicely and
 * transparently with EMF's extension mechanisms some of the more advanced functions may require to add direct
 * dependencies on CDO to your application code.
 * <p>
 * The following diagram illustrates the major building blocks of a CDO application: <p align="center">{@image application-architecture.png}

   * OSGi
   * <p>
   * All components of CDO are implemented as <a href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi</a> bundles. The core components of
   * both clients and servers do not require OSGi to actually run to be functional, they can perfectly be operated
   * stand-alone. If OSGi is running the setup and configuration of some CDO facilities is a little simpler than in
   * stand-alone mode because the needed {@link IFactory factories} get automatically registered with the central
   * {@link IPluginContainer wiring container}.
   * <p>
   * CDO utilizes an {@link OMPlatform operations and maintenance} framework to abstract common platform services such
   * as {@link OMLogger logging}, {@link OMTracer tracing}, {@link OMMonitor monitoring} and {@link OMPreference
   * configuration}. Without the need to depend on additional external libraries these services integrate seamlessly
   * with OSGi, if available at runtime, or emulate similar functionality if running stand-alone.

  /**
   * CDO Client
   * <p>
   * The CDO client enables an application to open one or more {@link CDOSession sessions}. Each session represents
   * a connection to a {@link IRepository repository} and provides a broad API to interact with it. A session does <b>not</b>
   * provide direct access to model <i>instances</i>; {@link CDOView views} or {@link CDOTransaction transactions} are needed
   * to navigate or modify the model instance graph.
   * <p>
   * A session consists of several generic (network and storage independent) <b>components</b>, such as:
   * <p>
   * <ul>
   * <li>a {@link CDORevision revision} {@link CDORevisionManager manager} and {@link CDORevisionCache cache},
   * <li>a {@link CDOBranch branch} {@link CDOBranchManager manager},
   * <li>a {@link EPackage package} {@link CDOPackageRegistry registry},
   * <li>a {@link CDOCommitInfo commit info} {@link CDOCommitInfoManager manager},
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * All <b>communication aspects</b> (the sending/receiving of signals to/from a network system) are fully abstracted
   * through the service provider interface (SPI) {@link CDOSessionProtocol}. Concrete implementations are fully separated
   * and can be plugged into the core as described in {@link Protocol}.

   * Models
   * <p>
   * The models, usually in the form of interfaces that are generated by {@link EMF}, represent the business knowledge

   * and they're used by the generic {@link Client CDO client} to manage, e.g., load, commit, query, the business data.
   * <p>
   * CDO can transparently support <i>scalable</i> models such that arbitrary, single {@link CDOObject objects} are loaded
   * on demand and automatically unloaded (garbage collected) when they're no longer needed. For these sophisticated
   * features to work properly and efficiently the models have to be re-generated with slightly modified GenModel properties.
   * The CDO SDK comes with a convenient migrator tool for existing GenModels and an importer tool for new GenModels.
